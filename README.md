Ocular event detection for monocular video-based eye-trackers
Here you can find MATLAB codes to detect saccades, fixations, blinks, and processing of the time-series of pupil diameter.
The codes are based on well-known algorithms in the literature, which are mentioned in-line with the codes.
You may need to customize the codes based on the eye-tracker you are using.
